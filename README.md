Course 2 of TensorFlow in Practice specialization

### Week 1 : we saw how to explore the training history and discovered an interesting phenomenon: Even though the training data setâ€™s accuracy went very high, we saw that after only a few epochs, the validation set levelled out. This is a clear sign that we are overfitting again. Using more data should help with this, but there are some other techniques that you can use with smaller data sets too.

### Week 2 : we looked at the really useful tool that TensorFlow gives you with Image Augmentation. With it, you can effectively simulate a larger dataset from a smaller one with tools to move images around the frame, skew them, rotate them, and more. It can be an effective tool in fixing overfitting.
